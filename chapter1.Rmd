# About the project/ week 1

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your github repository here. This is an R markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R markdown syntax. See the 'Useful links' page in the mooc area (chapter 1) for instructions.*

Hopefully this course gives me some new tools for analysing large datasets. Would be cool to finally learn to use GitHub as well!
